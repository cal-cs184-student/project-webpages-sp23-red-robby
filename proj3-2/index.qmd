## Overview



In this project, we added features to support the rendering of more materials
based on project 3-1. Specifically, our implementation can now support the
rendering of the following materials: mirror, glass, and metals. For mirror, we
used perfect specular reflection; for glass, we used refraction; for metal, we
used the microfacet model.

The implementation of this project is conceptually easy but the computation
aspect is a little complicated and requires a great understanding of each of the
formulas we need to use during the implementation. Overall, this project is
extremely rewarding as the rendering results are much closer to reality compared
to the other half of the project.

## Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials

Below we rendered the CBspheres.dae with 64 samples per pixel, 4 samples per light, and different levels of max_ray_depth.

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![max_ray_depth = 0](./CBspheres_0.png)

![max_ray_depth = 1](./CBspheres_1.png)

:::

When max_ray_depth = 0, only the light source will be visible since lighting up other parts requires at least one bounce.

When max_ray_depth = 1, we see only see direct lighting. The two spheres are mostly dark except in the small areas where the reflection of the light source took place.


::: {layout-ncol=2}

![max_ray_depth = 2](./CBspheres_2.png)

![max_ray_depth = 3](./CBspheres_3.png)

:::

When max_ray_depth = 2, we can clearly observe the mirror sphere because it took two bounces for the light to hit the sphere and hit the box.

When max_ray_depth = 3, we can clearly observe the glass sphere as well because it took three bounces for the light to enter the sphere, exit the sphere, and hit the box.




::: {layout-ncol=3}

![max_ray_depth = 4](./CBspheres_4.png)

![max_ray_depth = 5](./CBspheres_5.png)

![max_ray_depth = 100](./CBspheres_100.png)

:::



For max_ray_depth = 4/5, the only noticeable difference is the glass sphere got more noise in it and this is because as more bounces occur, the glass sphereâ€™s noise level will get closer and closer to its surrounding noise level. 

When max_ray_depth = 100, everything has converged, and there's no noticeable difference.

## Part 2

### Varying Alpha

Here we render ``CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae`` with $\alpha$ set to 0.005, 0.05,
0.25, and 0.5. For each, we take 256 samples per pixel, 4 samples per light, and 
maintain a ray depth of 7. 

::: {layout-ncol=2}
![$\alpha = 0.5$](./img/dragon_alpha_0-5.png)

![$\alpha = 0.25$](./img/dragon_alpha_0-25.png)

![$\alpha = 0.05$](./img/dragon_alpha_0-05.png)

![$\alpha = 0.005$](./img/dragon_alpha_0-005.png)

:::

We can observe that as $\alpha$ decreases, the material becomes "shinier" (or
glossier/specular) and becomes more reflective of its surroundings. At $\alpha =
0.5$, we faintly see the influence of the red wall on the throat of the dragon
(and likewise we faintly see the blue influence on its tail), but it is
otherwise a matte golden.  At $\alpha = 0.25$, these influences become more
apparent, and by $\alpha = 0.05$, it is reflective to the point of being
comparable to a mirror. We also note that at this point there exists a side
effect of many white points across the image. These are most severe at $\alpha =
0.005$.

### Comparison with Cosine Hemisphere Sampling

Here we compare our implementation of Importance Sampling with the provided
implementation of Cosine Hemisphere Sampling. For each, we take 64 samples 
per pixel, 1 sample per light, and maintain a ray depth of 7.

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![Importance Sampling](./img/bunny_importance_sampling.png)

![Cosine Hemisphere Sampling](./img/bunny_cos_sampling.png)

:::

We can observe that the room itself is quite similar in both images as the walls
and floor both converge quickly. However, in the details of the bunny we see
that the details in Cosine Hemisphere Sampling are poorly approximated, with
many excessively dark regions (e.g., the further ear) and an abundance of
blackpoints throughout the body.

### Additional Materials

Here we present ``CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae`` with alternate materials, obtained 
by modifying the $\eta$ and $k$ values in the file. These values were obtained 
from the following site: <https://refractiveindex.info>. For each rendering, 
we take 256 samples per pixel, 4 samples per light, and maintain a ray depth of 7.

![Zinc ($\eta = \{ 1.1181, 0.92678, 0.71515 \}$, $k = \{ 5.5577, 4.9657, 4.1696 \}$)](./img/dragon_material_zinc.png)

![Franckeite ($\eta = \{ 3.4982, 3.4147, 2.5670 \}$, $k = \{ 0.47698, 0.84051, 1.3236\}$)](./img/dragon_material_franckeite.png)

Note the the first, Zinc, is a conductor material, while the latter is a
sulfosalt which we tried for fun.

## Collaboration

We each led a specific section, with Isolde leading the first part and Jakob
leading the second. We communicated and planned over text, and pair programmed
over Zoom. The project was less time consuming compared to the previous and went
smoothly. The collaboration process was very similar to our past experiences, so
we didn't learn anything further in this regard.
